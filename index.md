# Data Analysis and Visualisation in R - Bite-size edition

TinyURL https://tinyurl.com/bs-intR

## Description: 

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning
and preparing the data. In this course we introduce a suite or R packages
collectively known as the **tidyverse**; this includes the packages *tidyr*,
*dplyr*, *ggplot2* and *stringr*. In combination these provide a powerful
toolkit to make the process of manipulating and visualising data easy and
intuitive.  

This material is normally taught in an intensive 1 day course, however, in this
series it is presented as six 1.5 hour sessions (with homework!).  
This format will enable you to:   

* Fit in wet-lab work around your dry-science training.   
* Consolidate your learning gradually through practive between teaching
  sessions.  
* Allow a more leisurely and flexible training schedule.  

## Course Prerequisites


* This is an intermediate-level R course aimed at students and research
  scientists who are already comfortable using R, but who are either not
  familiar with, or would like to improve their skills in, plotting using
  ggplot2 and data manipulation using the dplyr and tidyr.
* We will be using RStudio, so if you are not already using RStudio to write R
  code, it would be helpful to spend some time familiarizing yourself with
  RStudio. 

## Objectives

After this course you should be able to:

* Create reproducible documents
* Import and tidy and datasets into R
* Use dplyr to explore a dataset interactively
* Produce simple analysis workflows in R
* Make publication-ready graphics using ggplot2

## Aims

During this course you will learn about:

* How R enables reproducible research
* What constitues a tidy dataset
* "Piping" commands together to form a workflow
* Subseting and filtering datasets using dplyr
* Producing summary statistics from a dataset
* Joining datasets using dplyr
* The grammar of graphics approach to plotting used in ggplot2
