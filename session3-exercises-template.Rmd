# Messy data - clean up with mutate and stringr

This week we would like you to clean up the data set in the `patient-data.txt`
file that we looked at during session 3. As we saw whoever has entered the data
has made a number of mistakes, such as including "cm" in the `Height` column.

First load the data from the file. Then inspect each column to see if there are
errors you need to correct. Use `mutate` and functions from the `stringr`
package, e.g. `str_remove`, to clean up the data.

```{r}

```
